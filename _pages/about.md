### Welcome! 

I am Antoine Aspeel, Ph.D. in Control and Optimization. My research interests are about safety control, reachability analysis, networked control systems, and resource-aware control. I am currently doing a postdoc at the University of Michigan under the advising of [Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/).

### Bio

I was born in Belgium. I received B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in Mathematical engineering at the UCLouvain, Belgium. In 2022, I defended my PhD in mathematical engineering under the supervision of [Raphaël Jungers](https://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/content/home) and [Benoît Macq](https://pilab.be/about-me/?p=benoit_macq) in the ICTEAM at UCLouvain, Belgium. I received my master degree in mathematical engineering from the same institute.
