#### Welcome! 

I am Ruya Karagulle, Ph.D. student in Control field at Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Michigan under my advisor Necmiye Ozay. My research is mainly focused on formal methods and machine learning, where I am trying to combine the advantages of machine learning with formal methods to infer better specifications for systems.
