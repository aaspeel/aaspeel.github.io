### Welcome! 

I am Antoine Aspeel, Ph.D. in Control and Optimization. My research interests are about safety control, reachability analysis, networked control systems, and resource-aware control.

 I am currently doing a postdoc with [Antoine Girard](https://sites.google.com/site/antoinesgirard/) and [Thiago Alves Lima](https://sites.google.com/view/thiagoalveslima/home) at the [L2S](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/), part of CentraleSupélec (Paris Saclay).

### Bio

I was born in Belgium. I received B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in Mathematical engineering at the UCLouvain, Belgium.

In 2022, I defended my PhD in mathematical engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Raphaël Jungers](https://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/content/home) and [Prof. Benoît Macq](https://pilab.be/about-me/?p=benoit_macq) in the ICTEAM at UCLouvain, Belgium.

After completing my PhD, I pursued a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan, working with [Prof. Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/).
