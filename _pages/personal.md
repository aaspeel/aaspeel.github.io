Life is a balance between work and personal interests. You can find my interests other than research and engineering.

Painting
=======
When I do painting, I remember the feeling of being in the zone. My favorite and oldest pastime activity, I use its help whenever I feel stressed and confused. You can find some of my works I completed during my Ph.D years.

Sailing
======
Born in a coastal city and growing up in Istabul, Turkey, I was always surrounded by sailing boats and yachts. I found the opportunity to learn sailing during my undegraduate years with the university's sailing club. Sailing is the perfect escape when the wind is good and it is a great extreme sport when there is heavy wind.

<!-- Running and Yoga
======
Sailing is a great sport but after all I live in Ann Arbor now, Lake Michigan is not that close, and we are famous for cold winter days (weeks I can say) :). Before I met sailing, I was running and doing yoga. Yoga is an excellent choice for releasing tension from the body.  -->
