My research focuses on **safety control** and **networked control systems**. My aim is to contribute to the development of mathematical and algorithmic tools for designing controllers that guarantee safety properties of large-scale systems. A key component of my research is the design of **resource-aware** controllers for networked systems, while ensuring performance and safety specifications.

By combining these areas, I strive to contribute to the development of robust and efficient control tools for the next-generation of **cyber-physical systems**.

# Overview of some of my recent works

### Koopman-like Lifted Systems for Correct-by-Design Control

* We introduce _lifted systems_ as a generalization of finite-dimensional Koopman approximations to systems with inputs.
* A notion of simulation relation is defined between lifted systems. It is proved that this simulation relation implies the containment of both the open- and closed-loop behaviors.
* These results enable us to compare different lifting functions and alternative lifted systems in terms of their usefulness in control design.
* This simalation relation generalizes (i) hybridizations, (ii) approximate immersions, and (iii) Koopman over-approximations.
* Can be used to enforce specifications (or to compute backward reachable sets).

### Minimum Sensors-to-Actuators Communication

* Design a controller that can be implemented with a minimum number of sensor-to-actuator messages, while satisfying safety constraints.
* Reduces to a matrix rank minimization problem.
* Solution relies on a new matrix factorization that decomposes the controller ùêä into an encoder ùêÑ and a decoder ùêÉ.

### Sparse Sensors and Actuators Activation

* Minimize the use of sensors and actuators, while satisfying safety constraints.
* Sensors/actuators sparsity is encoded as a linear constraint. We prove that this constraint remains linear after Youla parameterization.
* This leads to a scalable method for sensors/actuators scheduling.
