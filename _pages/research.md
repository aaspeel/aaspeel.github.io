My research focuses on **safety control** and **networked control systems**. My aim is to contribute to the development of mathematical and algorithmic tools for designing controllers that guarantee safety properties of large-scale systems. A key component of my research is the design of **resource-aware** controllers for networked systems, while ensuring performance and safety specifications.

By combining these areas, I strive to contribute to the development of robust and efficient control tools for the next-generation of **cyber-physical systems**.

## Some things I like (non-exhaustive and unordered list)

* Hybrid systems theory
* Formal methods
* Reachability analysis
* Koopman theory
* Scenario optimization
* Polynomial optimization (sum of squares)
* System level synthesis
* Youla parameterization
* Reinforcement learning (and inverse reinforcement learning)
